Shopping--App: My Pretend Online Store! 🛒
What is This?
Hi friends! This is my pretend online store app called Shopping--App. It’s a fun place where you can look at all kinds of products—like toys, clothes, electronics, books, and more—on the home page and put the ones you like into a shopping cart. It’s not a real store; it uses a pretend list of products (called a fake API) to show lots of different things you can “buy.” You can add products, change how many you want, or take them out of the cart. It works on big screens (like a laptop), medium screens (like a tablet), and small screens (like a phone)!
Why Did I Make It?
I wanted to build a pretend online store so I could learn how to make apps with React (a tool for building fun websites). I also wanted to practice using a fake API to get a list of products, and I made sure the app looks good on all devices—like your phone, tablet, or computer.
How to Play with My Pretend Store
Here’s how you can try my pretend store on your computer:

Get the Files:

Click the green “Code” button on this GitHub page and pick “Download ZIP”.
Unzip the folder on your computer (ask an adult if you need help).


Set It Up:

You’ll need a magic tool called Node.js to run my app. Ask an adult to install it from https://nodejs.org/.
Open your computer’s terminal (like “Command Prompt” on Windows or “Terminal” on Mac).
Go to the project folder. If you unzipped it on your Desktop, type:  cd Desktop/shopping--app


Type this to get the extra tools my app needs:  npm install




Start the Pretend Store:

In the terminal, type:  npm run dev


Press Enter. It’ll show a link like http://localhost:5173. Open that link in your browser (like Chrome or Safari).


Play with It:

You’ll see a big sign at the top (called a Navbar) with a cart icon.
Below that, there are lots of products on the home page—like toys, clothes, electronics, and more.
Click “Add to Cart” on a product to put it in your shopping cart.
On a big screen, the cart is on the right. On a small screen (like a phone), it’s below the products.
In the cart, you can press + or - to change how many items you want, or “Remove” to take an item out.
If you try to add the same item again, a message will pop up saying “Item already added to the cart”.



What I Used to Build It
I made this app with these tools:

React: To build the fun parts of the website.
Vite: To make the app start fast.
React Router: To move between pages (like the home page).
Fetch API: To get the pretend list of products from the fake API.

What I Learned

How to make a website that looks good on phones, tablets, and computers.
How to use a fake API to show lots of different products in my app.
How to let people add products to a cart and change the number of items.
How to show a message when someone tries to add the same item twice.
How to fix bugs (like making sure the cart shows up on all devices).

Things I Want to Add Later

A search button to find products faster.
More pictures of the products in the cart.
A way to save your cart so you can come back later.

Who Helped Me
I got help from my friend Grok (made by xAI) to build this app and fix problems, like making the cart show up on all devices.
